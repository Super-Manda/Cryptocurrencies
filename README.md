## :atom:  Purpose
###
There are important clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.  One client, Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, wishes to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its customers, but is struggling to understand which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.  Since the expected output is unknown, unsupervised machine learning will be used.

## :atom:  Analysis
### In deliverable 1, the original dataset was cleaned and prepared.  
- This is the dataset after cleaning. Upon checking this DataFrame, the next step was to create variables for text features and scale it.

### In deliverable 2, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce data dimensions to 3 principal components.
- This is what the table looked like.

### In deliverable 3, cryptocurrencies were clustered using k-means to group them.
- This resulted in an Elbow Curve:

- A 3d rotating graph was useful to see where the clusters existed.

### In deliverable 4, the results were visualized and shared with this client.
- A table of tradable currencies was shown.

- A 2d scatterplt was also useful.
