## :atom:  Purpose
###
There are important clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.  One client, Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, wishes to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its customers, but is struggling to understand which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.  Since the expected output is unknown, unsupervised machine learning will be used.

## :atom:  Analysis
- In deliverable 1, the original data will be prepared and cleaned.  
- In deliverable 2, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be used to reduce data dimensions to 3 principal components.
- In deliverable 3, cryptocurrencies will be clustered using k-means to group them.
- In deliverable 4, the results will be visualized to share with the client.
